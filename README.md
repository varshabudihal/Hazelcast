# Hazelcast

I worked with Hazelcast to scale the java application and the goal for working towards it was to understand the working mechanism of how the In Memory Data Grid access the data and provides an efficient way to run the applications concurrently

For the application to run, you need to run the GettingStarted.java. You will see clusters forming. you can again run the program and you see the second cluster being added.
